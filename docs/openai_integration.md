# OpenAI Integration

## Overview
The OpenAI API is central to the conversational capabilities of the `process-automation-agent`. It processes natural language inputs and generates intelligent responses.

## Features
1. **Natural Language Understanding**:
   - Processes user queries and commands.
   - Provides context-aware responses.

2. **Automation Tasks**:
   - Assists in scheduling, documentation, and follow-ups.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Detects and handles ambiguous inputs gracefully.

## Example API Call
```python
import openai

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="Generate a follow-up email for a meeting",
    max_tokens=150
)
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

## Best Practices
- Use concise and clear prompts for better results.
- Limit API calls to avoid rate-limiting issues.
- Log responses for debugging and optimization.
