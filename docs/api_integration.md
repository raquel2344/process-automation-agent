# API Integration

## Overview
The `process-automation-agent` integrates multiple APIs to provide its functionality.

## Supported APIs
1. **OpenAI API**:
   - Used for conversational AI and natural language understanding.
   - Handles tasks like generating responses, processing input, and automating follow-ups.

2. **Google Calendar API**:
   - Manages scheduling and calendar events.
   - Automates meeting creation and updates.

## API Management
1. **Discovery**:
   - The `api_collector.py` module identifies available APIs and their capabilities.

2. **Integration**:
   - Handled by the `api_manager.py` module, which manages API calls and responses.

## Configuration
- API keys are stored in environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY`).
- Configuration files can be updated to include new APIs.

## Error Handling
- Failed API calls are logged and retried up to three times.
- Detailed error messages are provided for debugging.
